# AquaCode

**AquaCode** is a no-code platform for building apps.
We’re bringing together the best features from Lovable, Base44, and Replit—Built with enterprise-grade open source tools.

- [x] **Authentication** — User and session management.
- [x] **Auto-generated APIs** — Automatically generated endpoints based on your app data.
- [x] **AI Providers** — Integration with AI models (Anthropic, Google).
- [ ] **Storage** — File and asset management system.
- [x] **Studio** — Visual editor to build apps without coding.

## Provider-Dependent Features

These features require an external provider (currently Vercel) to run.

## How it works

AquaCode is a no-code platform designed so anyone can create apps with no code.

We believe in a visual-first approach: create, design, and deploy from a single interface, while underneath runs a robust architecture powered by open services.

When there’s a reliable open-source tool, we integrate it.

When it doesn’t exist, we build it ourselves and share it with the community.

Our goal is to offer a simple, flexible, and scalable experience, allowing people to build apps without sacrificing control, transparency, or the ability to grow.
